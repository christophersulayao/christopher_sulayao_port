        <h3>Previously</h3>
        <p>
            Born in the Philippines and raised in California.
            Previous Executive Supervisor of Produce Operations for WinCo Foods. 
            There, I pushed many individuals to be a better version of themselves.
            Working closely with the IT department at times, I developed a taste for Computer Science.
            They developed an application for us to grade our stores based off of certain criteria.
            I was fascinated about how they were able to create such an application. 
            How did they choose their colors, their fonts, their images?  
            How did the data get captured? So here was where my passion for retail went away and my 
            passion for designing and developing started.

        <h3>The Journey Starts</h3>
        <p>
            My cousin was a developer who worked for a start up called Tile. 
            He talked to me about web development programs that gave you adequate training in 12 weeks to get a job. 
            So my research began. Hack Reactor was the main one, but based out of Los Angeles.
            This was too far for me. Coincidentally, a Facebook advertisement showed me LearningFuze, which was based in Irvine.
            I contacted the school and got some information. Not too long after that, I took their
            version of an entrance exam. I was able to get in!!!

        <h3>Extreme Dedication</h3>
        <p>
            In school I've accelerated in certain subjects like math and science. However, LearningFuze pushed me to my limits.
            I had a 1.5 hour drive to and from school each day. I was at the school from 9am to 7pm most days.
            I would even go in on Saturdays to go over some previous lectures. Alot of what I was learning was not sinking in.
            There were many nights where I wondered if I wasted my time. I couldn't have. I needed to do this for myself.
            On my drives to and from school, I would listen to the lectures, in hopes that something would stick.
            I got over my fear of looking dumb in front of people by asking questions and asking for clarification when I needed it.
            A classmate of mine, by the name of Danika played a huge role in my success.
            She was there any and everytime I needed help. She is a good friend. March 15th, our final day finally came along. Now what?

        <h3>Life After LearningFuze</h3>
        <p>
            I had to keep my mind sharp at the same time find a job because funds were running low.
            I ended up getting a job to help with funds, but my passion was in programming.
            A month after school ended, I met a wonderful lady through a meet-up that was in search for a junior level developer
            to help her with her application. I got a job :-)
